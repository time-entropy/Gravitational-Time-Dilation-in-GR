Gravitational (or equivalent gravitational) time dilation stems from the local deformation of the SEQ network's elastic structure

Gravitational (or equivalent gravitational) time dilation stems from the local deformation of the SEQ network's elastic structure, directly linking gravity to spacetime's quantum mechanical properties:

sU(3)-Mediated Spacetime Strain: Mass-energy compresses local SEQ networks via SU(3) color interactions, storing energy as spatial strain (mass) while inducing external spacetime stretching (gravity). This anisotropic compression modifies the equilibrium spacing between SEQs, generating tension akin to a loaded spring.

Frequency Reduction Mechanism: The strained SEQ network exhibits lower resonant frequenciesâ€”a direct consequence of increased inter-SEQ tension. Since time is defined as the count of SEQ transformations, this frequency suppression slows local "time" evolution.

Equivalence Principle Reinterpreted: Acceleration-induced time dilation shares this mechanism: kinetic energy input during acceleration establishes interfacial SEQ strain, equivalently reducing transformation frequencies through elastic potential redistribution.
